 Outlier Engineering


An outlier is a data point which is significantly different from the remaining data. 
“An outlier is an observation which deviates so much from the other observations as to 
arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism.” [D. Hawkins. 
Identification of Outliers, Chapman and Hall , 1980].

Statistics such as the mean and variance are very susceptible to outliers. 
In addition, **some Machine Learning models are sensitive to outliers** 
which may decrease their performance. Thus, depending on which algorithm we wish to train, 
we often remove outliers from our variables.

We discussed in section 3 of this course how to identify outliers. 
In this section, we we discuss how we can process them to train our machine learning models.


## How can we pre-process outliers?

- Trimming: remove the outliers from our dataset
- Treat outliers as missing data, and proceed with any missing data imputation technique
- Discrestisation: outliers are placed in border bins together with higher or lower values 
  of the distribution
- Censoring: capping the variable distribution at a max and / or minimum value

**Censoring** is also known as:

- top and bottom coding
- winsorization
- capping


## Trimming or truncation

Trimming, also known as truncation, involves removing the outliers from the dataset. 
We only need to decide on a metric to determine outliers.this can be the Gaussian 
approximation for normally distributed variables or the 
inter-quantile range proximity rule for skewed variables.

### Advantages

- quick

### Limitations

- outliers for one variable could contain useful information in the other variables
- if there are outliers across many variables, we could remove a big chunk of dataset


## Important

Outliers should be detected AND **removed ONLY** from the training set, and NOT from the test set.

So we should first divide our data set into train and tests, and remove outliers in the train set, 
but keep those in the test set, and measure how well our model is doing.
